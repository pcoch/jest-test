# jest-test
Part of Odin Project Jest Learning:

Write tests for the following, and then make the tests pass!

A capitalize function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.

A reverseString function that takes a string and returns it reversed.

A calculator object that contains functions for the basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply. Each of these functions should take two numbers and return the correct calculation.

const object = analyzeArray([1,8,3,4,2,6]);

object == {
  average: 4,
  min: 1,
  max: 8,
  length: 6
};
